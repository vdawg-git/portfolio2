Hyprtheme is an app to easily apply themes to your Hyprland Linux desktop. I joined the project and created the webapp and contributed to the Rust cli code. The logo is also done by me.

For the webapp I used Astro and made sure that the theme images really shine, creating UI color-palette dynamically on build for eacht theme.

The development has stalled for now sadly. The webapp is basically done though.
