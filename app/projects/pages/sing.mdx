Sing is a music library built with Electron and was my first big project to learn Javascript/Typescript.

## Features

- Fuzzy search library by albums, artists, songs, playlists
- Playlists
- Intuitive interactive queue
- Interactive everywhere (add albumbs to queue, add songs to playlists)
- Fany dynamic cover backgrounds

## Techstack

The front-end is done with Svelte with Redux and the backend is NodeJS with Prisma.

Also fairly extensive E2E testing was done with Playwright.

<TechStack
	techs={[
		"Typescript",
		"Electron",
		"Svelte",
		"Node",
		"Prisma",
		"Playwright",
		"Tailwind",
		"Redux",
		"Figma",
	]}
/>

Now I achieved it. But I plan to create another simpler music library with a different tech-stack again.
